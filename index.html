		<h2 id="indonesian_fried_rice">INDONESIAN-STYLE FRIED RICE</h2>
		<i>SERVES 4 to 6</i><br>
		<p><b>Why this recipe works</b></p>
		<p>With well-seasoned grains of rice, crunchy fried shallots, and egg, Indonesian-style fried rice offers plenty of complexity in terms of both texture and flavor. Chile paste, a combination of shallots, garlic, and fresh Thai chiles, which gives the dish heady flavor, was easy to make in the food processor. Fish sauce plus shrimp, which we sauteed with the chile paste, worked well in lieu of shrimp paste, and adding dark brown sugar and molasses to regular soy sauce stood in for the specialty soy sauce typically used. Stir-frying freshly cooked rice results in mushy clumps, but we didn't want to mess with cooking rice a day ahead. Cooking rinsed rice in less water than our standard 3:2 ratio of water to rice, then chilling it for 20 minutes, got us very close to our goal, and coating the grains with oil before adding the water to the pan further guarded against mushy results. Scallions, lime, and slices of egg, which we cooked omelet-style was all we needed to finish the dish.</p>
		

		
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
				<blockquote>
				<p>If fresh Thai chiles are unavailable, substitute 2 serranos or 1 medium jalapeno. Adjust the spiciness of this dish by removing the ribs and seeds from the chiles. This dish progresses very  quickly beginning with step 5; it's imperative that your ingredients are in place and ready to go.  This dish is traditionally served with sliced cucumbers and tomato wedges.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 tablespoons plus <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup vegetable oil </li>
					<li>2 cups jasmine or long-grain white rice, rinsed</li>
					<li>2 <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cups water</li>
					<li>5 green or red Thai chiles, stemmed</li>
					<li>7 large shallots, peeled</li>
					<li>4 large garlic cloves, peeled</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons light or mild molasses</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
					<li>Salt</li>
					<li>4 large eggs</li>
					<li>12 ounces extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), peeled, deveined, tails <br>removed, and cut crosswise into thirds</li>
					<li>4 large scallions, sliced thin</li>
					<li>Lime wedges</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Method</h3>
			<ol>                
			<li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in large saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add rice and stir to coat grains with oil, about 30 seconds. Add water, increase heat to high, and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until all liquid is absorbed, about 18 minutes. Off heat, remove lid and place clean kitchen towel folded in half over saucepan; replace lid. Let stand until rice is just tender, about 8 minutes. Spread cooked rice onto rimmed baking sheet, set on wire rack, and cool for 10 minutes. Transfer to refrigerator and chill for 20 minutes.</li>

			<li>While rice is chilling, pulse chiles, 4 shallots, and garlic in food processor until coarse paste is formed, about 15 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Transfer mixture to small bowl and set aside. In second small bowl, stir together brown sugar, molasses, soy sauce, fish sauce, and 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoons salt. Whisk eggs and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt together in medium bowl.</li>

			<li>Thinly slice remaining 3 shallots (you should have about 1 cup sliced shallots) and place in 12-inch nonstick skillet with remaining <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup oil. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly, until shallots are golden and crisp, 6 to 10 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer shallots to paper towel–lined plate and season with salt to taste. Pour off oil and reserve. Wipe out skillet with paper towels</li>

			<li>Heat 1 teaspoon reserved oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add half of eggs to skillet, gently tilting pan to evenly coat bottom. Cover and cook until bottom of omelet is spotty golden brown and top is just set, about 1¹⁄2 minutes. Slide omelet onto cutting board and gently roll up into tight log. Using sharp knife, cut log crosswise into 1-inch segments (leaving segments rolled). Repeat with 1 teaspoon reserved oil and remaining eggs.</li>

			<li>Remove rice from refrigerator and break up any large clumps with fingers. Heat 3 tablespoons reserved oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until just shimmering. Add chile mixture and cook until mixture turns golden, 3 to 5 minutes. Add shrimp, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly, until exterior of shrimp is just opaque, about 2 minutes. Push shrimp to sides of skillet to clear center; stir molasses mixture to recombine and pour into center of skillet. When molasses mixture bubbles, add rice and cook, stirring and folding constantly, until shrimp is cooked, rice is heated through, and mixture is evenly coated, about 3 minutes. Stir in scallions, remove from heat, and transfer to serving platter. Garnish with egg segments, fried shallots, and lime wedges; serve immediately.</li>

		<h2 id="pan_roasted_fish">PAN-ROASTED FISH FILLETS</h2>
		<i>SERVES 4</i>

		<p>Thick white fish fillets with a meaty texture, like halibut, cod, sea bass, or red snapper, work best in this recipe. Because most fish fillets differ in thickness, some pieces may finish cooking before others—be sure to immediately remove any fillet that reaches 135 degrees. You will need a 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet for this recipe.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>4 (6- to 8-ounce) skinless white fish fillets, 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> inches thick</li>
			<li>Salt and pepper</li>
			<li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon sugar</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
			<li>Lemon wedges or relish (recipes follow)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Pat fish dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle very light dusting of sugar (about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> teaspoon) evenly over 1 side of each fillet. Heat oil in 12-inch ovensafe nonstick skillet over high heat until just smoking. Place fillets in skillet, sugar side down, and press down lightly to ensure even contact with pan. Cook until browned, 1 to 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> minutes. Using 2 spatulas, flip fillets, then transfer skillet to oven. Roast fillets until centers are just opaque and register 135 degrees, 7 to 10 minutes. Immediately transfer to serving plates and serve with lemon wedges or relish spooned over each fillet.</p>
